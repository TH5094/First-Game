# First-Game
This is just a simple game that I'm working on with the intention of learning. Made with Godot and by watching tutorials on the internet. Assets are from Brackeys and everything else is done by me. Good game design Isn't really a priority for this project since It's sole purpose is for me to learn basic game development principles and programming.
